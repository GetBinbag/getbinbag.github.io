# Binbag  

Code written to support Binbag, the waste management facility aggregator of India: [binbag.in](https://www.binbag.in/)

## Requirements  

## Updating the database   
  
## Pushing New Files to Github  
  
## IMPORTANT:  
  
1. We use a map from Mapbox, which has 50,000 free hits per year and then becomes paid.    
  - ping me when you notice something strange, maybe you have reached the 50,000 hits
